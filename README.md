# Professional README Generator

## Description

___

Welcome to the README generator.  This project will help the user generate a professional README without having to worry about apply proper markdown syntax.  This will save the user valuable time to work on other aspects of their projects.

What seperates a good project from a bad project can be a quality README.  A good README will showcase what your application does, explain and justify the technologies used, how to use your application and implement it in the future,  and finally discuss any challenges the user may have come across during their project.

There is no one right way to structure a quality README, but there is wrong way.  That would be to not include one at all.

Not to worry, with this README generator, simply answer a series of questions when prompted and your README will be generated.
